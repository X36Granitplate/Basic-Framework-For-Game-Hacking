- Hi, I’m @X36Granitplate
- I’m interested in game programming when it comes to making dynamic link library files to hack in a game.
- I’m currently learning c++ further, and besides javascript and lua.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any sort of open project when it comes to re building a game, or when it comes to any utilities for game design etc. Pretty much almost for anything.
- I live in germany.

- My main goal is to get to be a game developer, as i like programming in one of my favourite programming languages, such as c++ for example,
- when it comes to object oriented programming.
- I had been programming c++ now for almost 5 months now, and want to keep getting better at my programming skills.

- If you view my codes and you have any suggestions on how to improve its logic etc. Do suggest them, i'd appreciate it, as i am also still learning.

- How to reach me:
  By sending me an email through: kucuku.granit@gmail.com
